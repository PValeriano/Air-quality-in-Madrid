# Air-quality-in-Madrid
Contains the python program to visualize the quality of the air from Madrid, Spain.
This program relays in the local file "Estaciones.xlsx". The online file in the Madrid govern webpage contains some errors so you can
either use this file. The error in the online file (04/25/19) is about the format in some values of the longitude and latitude.
The .rar file contains the program (.py), the local file needed to add the coordinates of each station (.xlsx) and the information
needed to interprete the data from the file of the air quality.
The NO2.py file contains the same program but filter to visualize the NO2 levels and you dont need to download the full .rar file.
